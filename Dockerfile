# There are existing elasticdump user-contributed containers, but:
#  - they all rely on an outdated version;
#  - it's common to want to integrate elasticdump with some custom
#    scripts.
#
# This image can be use as a base to create custom automation tools
# based on elasticump and jq.
#
# See:
#  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/elasticdump
#  - https://stedolan.github.io/jq/
#
# Note that as we rely on a node:latest base, this may break on new
# node releases.
